Port Scanning is one of NMAP's key features. It is mainly used to scan and find available open ports using the command "nmap <host IP address or name>".
Note that the command -Pn is used in this task due to the suggestion provided before the successful scan to assume that the host is active, as well as
skipping the host discovery. This also allows a faster scan.

3. Service Detection
